This is a simple project developing a tic-tac-toe game. The project is especislly done for newbie programmers who are trying to learn javascript, html and css. If you trying to learn how you can make a html page dynamic, backing it up with some scripting, here you go.

## How to use?

- Clone the repo
- open the index.html file in your browser.

## What is there in the code?

### The 3 important files

- *index.html*: The project has an index.html file which has 9 cells required to play the game of tic-tac-toe.
- *style.css*: We are using style.css to style the tic-tac-toe board.
- *index.js*: We are linking the script index.js to make the game functioning.

## What more can be added?

- A second computer player will be a good addition in the project.


## What value this project can bring to your portfolio?

During my inital coding days, I use to keep thinking about where to start from to practiacally use my knowledge, and then I stumped upon the idea of developing something which I love to do.

Like a tic-tac-toe game we can make a sudoku board as well which will have a little more complexity involved. I will be writing a project for that soon.
